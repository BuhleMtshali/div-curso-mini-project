## 🖼️ Project Description
A fun mini-project where a circular div follows your cursor across the screen, while the background changes to a random gradient color! Perfect for learning about event listeners, mouse tracking, and dynamic styling with CSS.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML**: Structure of the page
- **CSS**: Styling and gradient effects
- **JavaScript**: Cursor tracking and dynamic background changes

## ✨ Features
- **Cursor-Following Div**: A small circle follows your cursor as you move it around.
- **Random Background Colors**: The background color changes randomly with a smooth gradient effect.
- **Touch Support**: Works on both desktop and touch devices.

## 🚀 How It Works
- **HTML** sets up the structure, including a div (`#my-div`) that will follow the cursor.
- **CSS** handles the layout, gradient backgrounds, and div styling.
- **JavaScript** tracks the mouse position and updates the div's position and the background color dynamically.
